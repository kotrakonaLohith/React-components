## Image File Input

`ImageInput` components require `id`, `label`, `text` and `name` props. `ImageInput` components should be used as uncontrolled form components. For fully controlled forms see the `Form` and `FormField` components. The `ImageInput` component will preview an image once one is selected.

<ImageInput
  className="mb-20"
  id="imageInput"
  name="imageInput"
  label="Upload Image"
  text="Choose an image from your files. For best results, use an image that is at least 500px wide."
/>

```tsx
<ImageInput
  className="mb-20"
  id="imageInput"
  name="imageInput"
  label="Upload Image"
  text="Choose an image from your files. For best results, use an image that is at least 500px wide."
/>
```
