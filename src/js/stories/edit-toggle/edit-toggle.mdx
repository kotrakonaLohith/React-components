# Edit Toggle (NOT CURRENTLY USED)

**DEPRECATED:** member profiles used to be edited inline. They no longer are. Keeping this component in case this functionality is needed in the future.

<TOC
  items={[
    'Basic Usage',
  ]}
/>

## Basic Usage

Use for sections of content that can be edited inline (eg. ~~Member Profiles.~~)

<EditToggle className="mb-32">
  <EditToggleContent>
    Content that can be editted here
  </EditToggleContent>
  <EditToggleForm>
    Form to edit content goes here
  </EditToggleForm>
</EditToggle>

```tsx
<EditToggle>
  <EditToggleContent>
    Content that can be editted here
  </EditToggleContent>
  <EditToggleForm>
    Form to edit content goes here
  </EditToggleForm>
</EditToggle>
```
